I don't know what I do now is right, those are wrong, and when I finally die then I know these.
So what  I can do now is to try to do everything well, and then wait to die .
Sometimes I can be very happy to talk to everyone, can be very presumptuous, but no one knows,
it is but very deliberately camouflage, camouflage; I can make him very happy very happy,
but couldn't find the source of happiness, just giggle.
